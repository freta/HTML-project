    <h1>Hobby</h1>
    <p>A hobby is usually defined as any enjoyable leisure activity that we engage in voluntarily and 
    consistently when we are free from the demands of work or other responsibilities. A hobby may be inspired 
    by an interst, but it typically requires more commitment and involves taking action, like learning a new skill,
     or collecting, building or creating something.Hobbies are essentially the <em>active pursuit</em> of a personal interest.
